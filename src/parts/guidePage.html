    <h3>Guide</h3>
    <p><b>WiseMove</b> helps you to evaluate candidate locations for selection based on the relative amount of travel associated with each location as well as scores assigned to each location based on subjective measures that you define.  Indicative travel times are obtained from Google Maps.  Scores for subjective measures are entered manually.</p>
    <h3>Step 1 - Map and Locations</h3>
    <p>The map page allows you to specify locations for evaluation.  A locations is either a candidate location <img src="images/map-marker-candidate.png"></img> being considered for selection, or a visit location <img src="images/map-marker-visit.png"></img>.  The amount of travel time associated with each candidate location is calculated based on the likely travel time from that location to each visit location.
    Visit locations are given a frequency score which indicates how often the location will be visited as compared to other visit locations in relative terms.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2 - Review Travel Times</h3>
    <p>The travel time page presents travel durations from all candidate locations to visit locations.  Durations are shown for single-trips as well as multiple-trips based on the frequency score for each visit location.
    </p>
    Travel times are indicative and are provided by OpenStreetMap and MapQuest.  In some locations, travel times may be unavailable or unreliable.  The Travel Time page provides functionality that allows you to enter travel times manually as a replacement for those automatically determined.
    <h3>Step 3 - Scores+</h3>
    <p>The Scores+ page provides links for managing locations, measures and scores.  New measures can be added, and the relative importance of each measure controlled through a weighting value.  The scores page allows you to enter scores associated with subjective measures (ie those not based on calculated travel times and distances).</p>
    <h3>Step 4 - Charts and Analysis</h3>
    <p>The Charts page provides a series of graphics that illustrate the relative scores, travel times and distances related to the candidate locations.
    The Scores chart illustrates the combined scores for all measures and candidate locations.  The scores for each measure are weighted based on weightings you assign.  A number of other charts are available.</p>
