WiseMove
========

A HTML5 mobile application for evaluating locations based on travel times and other measures.

This application has been deployed to the following address: http://wisemove.ppettit.net

The application requires a modern HTML5 capable browser, and can run on desktop or mobile devices.

The version at the site above has been tested from iPad and desktop browsers.  The version at the site above is not optimised for phone due to the loss of screen space due to the browser toolbars and chrome.  However, this can be resolved by packaging using Cordova or similar. 

Commentary on this application and the components used can be found on my blog: http://codecomments.ppettit.net
